# Decision Records

An explanation of and templates for creating decision records. Decision records are inspired by Michael Nygard's [Documenting Architecture Decisions](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions), but are intended to be applied more generallyâ€”towards any endeavor where you'd want your decisions tracked.

I'm tracking my understanding of decision records as decision records themselves. For an explanation of decision records, read through the [docs](docs).

## Recommended Usage

Create an initial decision record, using [init.md](templates/init.md). This serves as a reference to explain what decision records are. This record should be kept in a folder that you'll use for all decision records for the project.

For subsequent decision records, use a general [template](templates/template.md).
