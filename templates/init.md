# [ID]: Decision Records

Accepted: [Date]  

## Context
For this project, we need to make it clear what decisions are made and the rationales behind them. This should be clearly communicated to both current and future stakeholders.

## Decision
We will use Decision Records, as described [here](https://github.com/vple/decision-records). This will give us a log of our decisions, allowing people to understand what the decisions are as well as how and why they were made.

## Consequences
Contributors and stakeholders to this project should read about decision records, linked above.
